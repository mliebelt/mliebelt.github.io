# mliebelts starter blog

This is my second try to have a starter blog on gh-pages. This time I try to use Gatsby.js for that task.
Due to build reasons, I use for that a different repository, which leads to a different URL.

## Visiting the site

After deployment, the site should be visible under [https://mliebelt.github.io/mliebelts-blog/](https://mliebelt.github.io/mliebelts-blog/).

## Further steps

* Add from here to there additional content.
* Find ways to mix different things here (like blog articles made in pure HTML, mix of HAML, SASS, ...)
