# mliebelts starter blog

This is my second try to have a starter blog on gh-pages. This time I try to use Gatsby.js for that task.
Due to build reasons, I use for that a different repository, which leads to a different URL.

## Visiting the site

After deployment, the site should be visible under [https://mliebelts-blog.netlify.app/](https://mliebelts-blog.netlify.app/).

If you want to see something different from me, go to https://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/, my documentation to the PGN chess viewer.
